ðŸŽµ Artist Genre Similarity Graph
This project builds a graph connecting music artists based on shared genres using the Spotify API.

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
Fetches artists from a seed list using the Spotify Web API.

Collects each artist's genre tags.

Connects artists if they share at least one genre.

Visualizes the resulting graph with NetworkX and Matplotlib.

## Data Sources
- Artist/genre data: Spotify API (`artist_related_artists` and `search` endpoints)
- Genres are standardized by Spotify (e.g., "j-pop", "j-rock")

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python 3.12

Spotipy (Spotify Web API wrapper)

NetworkX (graph building)

Matplotlib (graph visualization)

ðŸ“š Notes
Some major artists (like Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga) may not return full genre or related-artist data through the API due to Spotify platform restrictions.

You can adjust the seed artists list inside graph.py to explore different artist networks.

ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements
Color nodes by primary genre.

Improve graph layout for larger datasets.

Allow user input to select seed artists dynamically.

Highlight clusters and genre communities.
